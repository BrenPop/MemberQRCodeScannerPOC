MemberQRCodeScannerPOC:

Welcome to my simple member QR code access project.

Things to note, the project contains a simple sqlite database with preloaded demo users.
You can find the test QR codes in the Images/QRCodes directory.


Steps to use the POC:

1. clone this repository locally
2. build the project
3. run the project
4. create test users by entering their name and email
5. test the qr code access by selecting a camera and starting the video
6. place an image of the selected QR code infront of the camera to scan
7. Either the QR code will be validated with an access allowed message, or an error user not found message.

For now that is it.
